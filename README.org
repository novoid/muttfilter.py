* Modifying FROM-email address in mutt emails

This script is using [[http://orgmode.org][Emacs Org-mode]] [[https://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#org-contacts][Org-contacts]] together with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client][MUA]]
[[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]].

Let's take a look at an example Org-contacts entry which looks like that:

: ** Bob Simpson                :research:chi09:BobSimpson:
: :PROPERTIES:
: :TYPE:
: :TITLE: Dr.
: :EMAIL: Bob.Simpson@example.com
: :oldEMAIL: Bob.Simpson@outdated.example.com
: :URL: http://example.com/bob
: :MOBILE:
: :HOMEPHONE:
: :WORKPHONE:
: :PHONE:
: :COMPANY: This cool research company
: :STREET: 42 Weirdstreet
: :POSTALCODE: 12345
: :CITY: Denver
: :COUNTRY: USA
: :PHOTOGRAPH: [[photo:BobSimpson.jpg]]
: :BORN: 1970-12-31
: :ITOLDTHEM_EMAIL: chi09@MY-DOMAIN.at
: :ITOLDTHEM_ADDRESS:
: :ITOLDTHEM_PHONE:
: :ADDRESS_CHANGE_METHOD: email
: :CREATED:  [2015-01-30 Fri 17:51]
: :END:
:
: - first contact: CHI conference 2009
:   - we had a nice lunch time together

Whenever I write an email to Bob (property ~:EMAIL:~), I would like to
use ~chi09@MY-DOMAIN.at~ (property ~:ITOLDTHEM_EMAIL:~) instead of my
standard email address.

This way, I can give away contact-specific email addresses. That's
quite handy when you've got a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-all][catch-all email domain]] or you are using
[[http://gmailblog.blogspot.co.at/2008/03/2-hidden-ways-to-get-more-from-your.html][some more or less hidden features of cloud-based email services]].

** How does it work? How do I install it?

Using mutt as email client, you can define your own editor. For me, I
like to compose emails using [[http://www.vim.org/][gVim]]. Therefore, my ~.mutt~ config file
usually contains the line:

: set editor=vim

If you replace this line by ...

: set editor="/usr/bin/python /home/USER/bin/muttfilter.py"

... you can use this script as a wrapper function. It parses your
Org-mode file for contacts, extracts their email addresses, and your
corresponding from-addresses. It compares the first from-address
from your current email and does a look-up. If it finds a
corresponding pair of entries in your Org-contacts file, the
~FROM:~-address gets replaced by the address of your choice.

After this, the gVim editor is opened to let you compose your email as
usual.

For debugging purposes, a log-file gets written to ~LOGFILENAME~ (see
code!) which is removed when no error occured. Please modify its path
if you got security concerns about that.

You might also take a look at following variables and adapt them to
your requirements:

- ~TMPFILENAME~: path to temporary file
- ~ORGCONTACTSFILE~: path to your Org-mode file containing the org-contacts-entries
- ~DEFAULT_EMAIL_ADDRESS~: your default email address
- ~EDITOR~: your default editor
